# AWS Web Application Firewall (WAF)
# Highly Configurable and Scalable, Cloud Native web application Layer-7 firewall giving you the first line of defense.]
There are **many security threats** that exist today in a typical enterprise distributed application.
1.	**DDoS:** Flood Attacks (SYN Floods, UDP Floods, ICMP Floods, HTTP Floods, DNS Query Floods), Reflection Attacks
2.	**Application Vulnerabilities:** SQL Injections, Cross Site Scripting (XSS), Open Web Application Security Project (OWASP), Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures (CVE)
3.	**Bad Bots:** Crawlers, Content Scrapers, Scanners and Probes
Out of these, AWS WAF can be used to handle security threats such as SQL injections, Cross Site Scripting (XSS) in a typical web application.
The web application HTTP requestss can be routed via AWS WAF and then will be forwarded to either one of the AWS services.
1.	AWS CloudFront (A Global Service)
2.	AWS API Gateway (A Regional Service)
3.	AWS Application Load Balancer (A Regional Service)
Logging and Monitoring of WAF are handled by Kinesis Firehose and CloudWatch respectively.
